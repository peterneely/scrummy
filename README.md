Scrummy
=======

This is an app for developers to keep track of what you are working on. It is intended to be used during daily scrums for a reminder about what you worked on yesterday, what you’re doing today, and any impediments you are facing.

Try it out here: https://scrummy.firebaseapp.com.

But don't get too attached. This is a work in progress and your data can be deleted at any time (scary) -- so treat it like a demo.

The app is written using AngularJS and Bootstrap. It is connected to Firebase as a backend, and hosted by Firebase, too. https://www.firebase.com/

Scrummy is mobile-first responsive and syncs immediately with all clients using web sockets. It is built using Yeoman’s angular generator (https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular), and uses grunt, jshint and a few other node modules.

It pains me to say that this has not yet been a test-driven project. I wanted to learn Angular first so that I could get comfy with what I will be driving before I drive it.

More to come.
