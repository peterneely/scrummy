Scrummy
=======

Scrummy is a web app for developers to keep track of what you have been working on. It is designed primarily for mobile so that you can sound confident and intelligent during daily scrums.

It is engineered with AngularJS and Bootstrap, connected to and hosted by Firebase, built with Grunt and love.

Try it out here: https://scrummy.firebaseapp.com.

But don't get too attached! This is a work in progress and your data can be deleted at any time (scary) -- so treat it like a demo for now.

The next step is to re-write it using TDD, now that I'm comfy with Angular. And to use SMACSS: https://smacss.com/.

More to come!
