scrummy
=======

This is an app for developers to keep track of what they are working on. It is intended to be used during daily scrums when you say what you worked on yesterday, what you’re doing today, and any impediments you are facing.

Try it out by registering here: https://scrummy.firebaseapp.com. BUT SEE CAVEAT BELOW!

The app is written using AngularJS, vanilla JavaScript and Bootstrap. It is connected to Firebase as a backend, and hosted by Firebase, too. https://www.firebase.com/

The app is mobile-first responsive and syncs immediately with all clients using web sockets. It is built using Yeoman’s angular generator (https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular), which uses grunt as a build tool and jshint to slap my wrists when my JavaScript is nothing less than lean and mean.

GIANT CAVEAT! This is an exceedingly alpha prototype to teach me basic, intermediate and advanced Angular concepts, and to a lesser degree, Bootstrap fundamentals. I cannot guarantee that any data you create through my app will remain there. It is a work in progress. Use at your own risk!

I am posting this on github mainly to demo my code.

It pains me to say that this has not been a test-driven project. I wanted to learn Angular first so that I could get comfy with what I will be driving before I drive it.
